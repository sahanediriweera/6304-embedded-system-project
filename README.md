Distance-Based Bus Ticketing System
This is an embedded system project for a distance-based bus ticketing system. The system utilizes RFIDs for passenger identification and GPS for distance detection. Passengers are charged based on the distance traveled during their bus journey.

Functionality
The distance-based bus ticketing system provides the following functionality:

Passenger Identification: RFIDs are used to uniquely identify passengers and associate them with their ticketing information.
Distance Tracking: GPS technology is employed to track the distance covered by the bus during the journey.
Fare Calculation: Passengers are charged based on the distance traveled, with the fare automatically calculated by the system.
Ticketing Management: The system manages ticket issuance, validation, and cancellation.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and analyze data related to passenger travel patterns, revenue, and bus performance.
Technologies Used
The distance-based bus ticketing system is built using the following technologies:

Embedded Systems: Hardware and software integration for developing a standalone system.
RFID Technology: Utilized for passenger identification and tracking.
GPS Technology: Used to measure the distance traveled by the bus.
Microcontroller: Controls the system operations and interfaces with the hardware components.
Programming Languages: C
Sensors and Peripherals: RFIDs, GPS module, display unit, input/output devices, etc.
Installation and Setup
Since this project involves both hardware and software components, the installation and setup process can vary depending on the specific hardware and microcontroller used. Generally, the following steps are involved:

Set up the hardware components, including the microcontroller, RFIDs, and GPS module, following the manufacturer's instructions.
Install the necessary software development tools, such as the IDE for programming the microcontroller.
Write the embedded software code that handles RFID reading, GPS data processing, distance calculation, fare calculation, and other required functionalities.
Flash the software code onto the microcontroller.
Connect the hardware components to the microcontroller, ensuring proper wiring and connections.
Power on the system and test its functionality, verifying that RFIDs are read correctly, GPS data is received accurately, and fare calculation is working as expected.
Please refer to the project's documentation or consult the hardware manufacturer's documentation for detailed instructions on installation and setup.
